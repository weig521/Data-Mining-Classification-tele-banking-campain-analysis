This project predicts customer responses to bank telemarketing campaigns using classification machine learning models. The analysis identifies key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions, enabling banks to optimize their marketing strategies and improve campaign effectiveness. 

We used the most popular classification models and chose the best fitting model (with most true positive and highest recall score) to help banks target the right customer groups fast to gain competitive advantage.

The data is from UCI: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing

The csv data is included, same as the detailed project report, power point, and the Python code & comments for the whole analysis.

If you are interested in SQL Database, you are welcome to check my other repository: https://github.com/weig521/Advanced-Database-SQL-developer-project/tree/main. The database project makes use of the same original data and demonstrates various SQL skills and more.
